Circular Random Walk - Monte Carlo Simulation

A Python implementation in Jupyter Notebook after David Robinson's 'The '[circular random walk' puzzle: tidy simulation of stochastic processes in R](http://varianceexplained.org/r/cranberry-sauce/)' at [Variance Explained](varianceexplained.org).  
David's solution in R is explained in [his video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1oKh9eeqkY) and can be downloaded from [his repository](https://github.com/dgrtwo/data-screencasts).
